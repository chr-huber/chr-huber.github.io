<!--
                      <h5>Propose and run an experiment</h5>
-->
                      <h5>What?</h5>
                      <p>
                          Research teams (RTs) are solicited to participate in a project examining the <span class="emph">methodological variability and design variability of experiments in behavioral economics</span>.
                          In particular, the project focuses on the variablity in methods when the same research question is examined by different research teams.
                          As there are various choices to make along the way, methods as well as results are likely to show some heterogeneity.
                          The variation in experimental methods will allow for valuable metascientific insights.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          All participating RTs will propose <span class="emph">an experimental research design with the objective of analyzing the impact of competition on moral behavior</span> fulfilling a certain set of very simple criteria.
                          Each RT will freely analyze the data using their own methodology and will provide effect sizes and standard errors regarding several specific a-priori hypotheses. All RTs will be anonymized prior to reporting or subsequent sharing of the submitted results.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          In particular, in Stage 1, each participating RT will submit a design proposal following a given template, outlining the key parameters of their proposed experiment.
                          If <i>more</i> than 40 submitted design proposals are eligible for participation, 40 designs will be <i>randomly</i> selected for being included in the study.

                          In Stage 2, each of the 40 selected design proposals will be implemented as an online experiments using Prolific.
                          RTs are programmig the software for their submitted design proposals als are hosting the software while the experiment is conducted and paid for by the project coordinators (PCs).

                          In Stage 3, all RTs will be asked to read 10 other design proposals, submitted by their peers, and evaluate them using a short questionnaire.
                      </p>
<!--
                      <p>
                          When applying to participate, RTs will fill out a survey with background information about the team. After reporting their Stage 1 results, they will fill out an incentivized survey about their beliefs about the variation in Stage 1 results across RTs for each hypothesis. Sign-up as a research team! [sign-up closed: see Overview for details]
                      </p>
-->
                      <p>
                          We expect that the total workload for research teams participating in the project will be between two and three weeks.
                      </p>

                      <h5>When?</h5>
                      <p>
                          The project coordinators recruit research teams (RTs) between April and May 2021.
                          Eligible RTs will design their experiment and submit their proposals by June 2021.
                          During the summer, all selected RTs will program the experimental software for their submitted designs and submit their software and instructions by the end of September 2021.
                          Starting in October 2021, pilot sessions for all experiments will be run to confirm feasibility.
                          From November 2021 to February 22, all selected experiments will be conducted online using Prolific.
                          Data analysis by RTs and the project coordinators will start after all selected experiments have been completed.
                          The overall project will last until summer 2022. For a detailed schedule of the project, please refer to the schedule.
                      </p>

                      <h5>Why participate?</h5>
                      <p>
                          In addition to being part of a fascinating project, you will get the chance to satisfy the curiosity of the academic in you, hungry for answers to a highly relevant and controversial research question.
                          For the proposals selected for implementation, we will cover the costs for participant payments.
                          Moreover, all participating researchers of the selected RTs will be listed as co-authors on the final paper.
                          They will thus become co-author of a paper that targets publication in a top scientific journal.
                          The organizers were very successful with a paper on crowd-analyses  in neuroscience, which yielded a 2020 publication in Nature (see <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2314-9" target="_blank">here</a>).
                          We take an innovative approach by &ndash; for the first time in behavioral economics &ndash; crowd-sourcing the research designs and letting the relevant community judge which proposals it considers the most valid and most relevant ones.
                      </p>

                      <h5>Who?</h5>
                      <p>
                          RTs consist of one or two participants. At least one of the members of the RT has to hold a PhD in Economics, Psychology or a related field and at least one team member needs one experimental study that is either published (accepted for publication) or a working paper.
                          The team should be sufficiently skilled in experimental methodology and should be familiar with the conceptualizing and implementing (programming) an economic online experiment.
                          RTs need to apply to participate by filling out a brief survey about background characteristics and expertise in behavioral and experimental economics.
                          The project coordinators will then decide whether the RT is sufficiently qualified to participate by majority voting.
                          After an RT is invited to participate, an agreement is signed where the project coordinators pledge to ensure anonymity
                          (i.e., not revealing the identity of RTs members to anyone outside the project coordination team) and RTs promise to ... XXXXXXX

                      <h2>design conditions</h2>

                      <p>
                          To be considered for this project, your experiment has to follow the following <span class="emph">design conditions</span>:
                          <ul>
                              <li>Be designed to be implemented as an online experiment on Prolific with 400 observations:</li>
                              <ul>
                                  <li>The experiment needs to be administered online on <a href="https://www.prolific.co/" target="_blank">Prolific</a>.</li>
                                  <li>Design adheres to Prolific's <a href="https://www.prolific.co/assets/docs/Researcher_Terms.pdf" target="_blank">terms & conditions for researchers</a>.</li>
                              </ul>
                              <li>Employ a between-subjects treatment design with two equally sized control and treatment groups:</li>
                                  <ul>
                                      <li>one control condition without competition</li>
                                      <li>one treatment condition with competition</li>
                                  </ul>
                              <li>Incentive compatible payments for subjects that cover at least the opportunity cost of time (Prolific implements the requirement of GBP 5 per hous as minimum payment), are not negative (losses), and are paid out confidentially.</li>
                              <li>Define a clear measure of moral behavior.</li>
                              <li>No deception of subjects.</li>
                              <li>Subject anonymity regarding who is interacting with whom during the experiment.</li>
                              <li>No measurements of physical state (e.g., saliva samples, blood samples) and no physical or psychological harm.</li>
                              <li>Clear information for subjects regarding the experiment’s duration, repetitions, interactions, and random processes (like lotteries) that are relevant for subjects, and which information is common knowledge to other (groups of) subjects.</li>
                              <li>Design clearly defines randomization procedures across treatments.</li>
                          </ul>
                          Borderline criteria will be voted on by the project coordinators (majority rule).

                      <p>
                          Each proposal should be no longer than two pages (see template <a href="#">here</a>) and should outline an experimental design (for further information on the proposal, click <a href="#">here</a>).
