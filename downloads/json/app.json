In our experiments, participants are able to gain \"simulated experience\" by random sampling of a previously described return distribution. We find that simulated experience considerably improves participants‚Äô understanding of the underlying risk‚Äìreturn profile and prompts them to reconsider their investment decisions and to choose riskier financial products without regretting their higher risk-taking behavior afterwards. This method of experienced-based learning has high potential for being integrated into real-world applications and services.","field":0,"DescTheory":"Descriptive","Type":"Individual Decision Experiment","No_authors":3,"No_pages":33,"Google_Scholar_citations":90},{"journal":"RF","year":2015,"vol.":"19","issue":"4","Authors":"Brice Corgnet; Roberto Hern„°N-Gonz„°Lez; Praveen Kujal; David Porter","article":"The Effect of Earned Versus House Money on Price Bubble Formation in Experimental Asset Markets","field":0,"DescTheory":"Descriptive","Type":"Market Experiment","No_authors":4,"No_pages":33,"Google_Scholar_citations":104},{"journal":"RF","year":2016,"vol.":"20","issue":"1","Authors":"Hazel Bateman; Christine Eckert; John Geweke; Jordan Louviere; Stephen Satchell; Susan Thorp","article":"Risk Presentation and Portfolio Choice","field":0,"DescTheory":"Descriptive","Type":"Individual Decision Experiment","No_authors":6,"No_pages":28,"Google_Scholar_citations":29},{"journal":"RF","year":2016,"vol.":"20","issue":"2","Authors":"Eduardo B.
