???

Result 1: Finance professionals show less risk-taking behavior in WAVE 2 of the experiment. In
contrast, students do not exhibit changes in risk taking.

Result 2: Finance professionals’ perception of the riskiness of the experimental asset drops markedly
during the COVID-19 stock market crash. In contrast, students do not exhibit changes in risk perception
across the waves.

Result 3: Finance professionals’ price and return forecasts and their satisfaction levels with the
asset do not differ between the two experimental waves. Again, students’ behavior does not differ
across waves.

# Bubbles and Financial Professionals

### Christoph Huber w/ Utz Weitzel, Jürgen Huber, Michael Kirchler, Julia Rose, and Florian Lindner

---
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;

# Motivation

- Financial bubbles have been recurring phenomena in history, spanning across different time periods, economies, and asset classes

- Conjecture that bubbles emerged with different investor classes being active (e.g.,professionals, inexperienced investors)

--
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

__Research Question:__
How do financial professionals contribute to price efficiency in asset markets?

???

Behavior of financial professionals can differ from student subjects:  higher degree of myopic loss aversion; less prone to anchoring than students; react more strongly to rank incentives; also show herd behavior similar to students


---
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;

# Experimental Design

- Experimental asset market over 20 periods of 120s

  - 8 traders per market

  - Final buyback price of 28 Taler
  
  - Dividend and interest payments &lt;br&gt;
    `\(\rightarrow\)` Fundamental value of the asset is 28 at each point in time
  
--

- 4 Treatments:

  - 2 Bubble Drivers: INCreasing cash, HIGH cash (in relation to assets)
  
  - 2 Bubble Moderators: increasing cash with SHORT selling, LOW cash

# The Effect of Experts’ and Laypeople’s Forecasts on Others’ Stock Market Forecasts

### Christoph Huber w/ Jürgen Huber and Laura Hueber

---
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;

# Motivation

- Laypeople rely on expert advice when making investments &lt;br&gt;
  `\(\rightarrow\)` financial advisors, fund managers, etc.
  
- Emergence of social networks and social trading platforms &lt;br&gt;
  `\(\rightarrow\)` _social information_ is an increasingly important aspect in financial decision-making

--

&lt;br&gt;

__Research Questions:__ 

- How are experts' and laypeople's own forecasts influenced by information about other people’s forecasts?
- Do experts/laypeople expect experts/laypeople to be better in forecasting the stock market? Are they?

---
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;

# Experimental Design

Main Tasks

- 30-day return prediction of S&amp;P 500, FTSE 100, ExxonMobil, BP
  - e.g. "Over the next 30 days, for the S&amp;P 500 stock index, I expect the 
  return to be ..." 

- Forecasting accuracy
  - e.g. "What do you think is the forecasting error of the US-American general 
  population's return prediction regarding the US-American S&amp;P 500 stock index?"
  
---
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;

# Experimental Design

2 `\(\times\)` 2 `\(\times\)` 3 treatment design

- 2 subject pools from 2 different countries

- 3 information levels
  - No information
  - Information on general population forecasts
  - Information on finance professionals forecasts

- all subject pools expect lower estimation errors for financial professionals 
than for laypeople `\(\rightarrow\)` _trust in experts_

???

For each asset and for each subject group, the estimated forecasting errors for the general
population (yellow bars) are consistently higher than the estimated forecasting errors
for financial professionals (blue bars) as the blue bar is lower than the yellow one in
each panel. This difference is statistically significant at the 5% level in 13 out of 16
comparisons. As a key observation, we thus report that all subject groups expect more
accurate forecasts by financial professionals than by people from the general population.
This confidence, however, is unjustified in our study, as we find no significant difference
between the actual forecasting errors of financial professionals and laypeople. Hence,
we can draw two conclusions: First, financial professionals are too optimistic about their
own forecasting accuracy compared to the predictions of the general population. And
second, the latter are also convinced of the superior performance of financial experts
compared to their own forecasting abilities. This result is consistent with – and might
be a reason for – our findings above that especially laypeople act on the information
signals provided by financial professionals, supposedly as they trust these signals more
than their own judgement.

# Bad bankers no more? Truth-telling and (dis)honesty in the finance industry

### Christoph Huber w/ Jürgen Huber

---
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;

# Motivation

- Misconduct is prevalent in the finance industry

  - e.g. 7% of financial advisors in the US have misconduct record
    (with 1/3 repeated offenders; Egan et al., 2019)
    
  - Cohn et al. 2014: _banking culture_ leads to more cheating

--

&lt;br&gt;

__Research Questions:__

- Is the finance industry particularly prone to dishonesty?

- Do the situational _context_ and its _norms_ matter?

---
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;

# Experimental Design

- Task: _truthfully_ report a pre-defined number (31) &lt;br&gt;
  `\(\rightarrow\)` _individual_ measure of dishonesty

--

one of three different __framings__:

&lt;br&gt;

--

__Abstract__ context: .small[two possible states, subjects report current state]

# To Summarize and Conclude

--

- Apply experimental methods to answer questions relating to _behavior in
 financial markets_: individual investment decisions, market behavior
 and price efficiency, social information, and moral decision making

--

- Employ _finance professionals_ to address issues regarding external validity
 and to increase the results' generalizability

--

- Finance professionals ...
  - became more risk averse during/after the recent stock market crash
  - are similarly prone to bubble formation than students
  - are trusted by laypeople in their assessments
  - act more honestly in financial decision-situations

- Laypeople are strongly influenced by other people’s estimates, &lt;br&gt;
  financial professionals are less affected
- Fin.Prof. forecasts influence all subjects more than forecasts by laypeople

???

The yellow circle within each spike represents subjects’ mean point prediction, while the lower and upper capped spikes represent the means of subjects’ self-reported 10% and 90% quantile for their return estimates. The line between the capped spikes thus shows the average size of subjects’  80% confidence interval for their forecasts. The green diamonds represent the corresponding information signals that were provided to subjects before they entered their estimates. The leftmost of each set of three capped spikes represents subjects’ predictions in treatment I_NO

First, we focus on the yellow circles representing the corresponding average point prediction
for each spike. On the middle of each group of three spikes (representing treatment
IGP) we see that the provided signal is always comparatively high (between 6 and 10 percent
expected return for the next month), which is welcome for our analysis, as we can
then clearly see whether subjects’ forecasts are influenced by these signals. By visual
inspection it seems that this is indeed the case: subjects take the provided information
signal into account when making their forecasts as the average forecasts in treatment
IGP are always higher, by up to two percentage points, than in the baseline treatment
INO. 

A second main observation is that subjects only partly follow the provided signals,
as their forecasts are higher, but the (comparatively high) signal in treatment IGP is always
above the 90% quantile of forecasts – this holds for all twelve sub-groups in this
treatment. 

As a third observation we see that also subjects from the finance industry
tend to follow the signal from the general population, even though to a slightly smaller
degree than subjects from the general population, as on all four pairwise comparisons
the mean estimate of the general population is closer to the provided signal than the
mean of people from the finance industry

Turning to treatment IFI, in which we provide forecasting signals from the finance industry, we see that the signals are on average markedly
lower than the (relatively high) ones in treatment IGP and usually very close to the average
forecasts elicited in treatment INO. Thus, we cannot as unequivocally judge whether
subjects follow the signal and find only minor differences between the level of return
predictions in treatments INO and IFI

# Conclusion


- professionals’ __investments dropped by 12%__ from December 2019 to the end of March 2020;
  despite _no change in expectations_
  - drop was not driven by beliefs, but by elevated levels of risk aversion

- professionals consider the experimental asset to be __less risky__ in March 2020 than in December 2019;
  - asset’s volatility in the experiment appeared relatively moderate compared to the volatility cluster in real-world markets in March 2020

- Investor behavior is shaped by:
  - _reinforcement learning_ and _countercyclical risk aversion_
  - _context-dependence_, _normalization_, _contrast effects_

- How does the experience of volatility shocks, such as the COVID-19 stock market crash, influence financial professionals’ risk-taking behavior?

- `\(\rightarrow\)` investment experiments before and during the climax of the crash

&lt;br&gt;


Result 1: Finance professionals show less risk-taking behavior in WAVE 2 of the experiment. In
contrast, students do not exhibit changes in risk taking.

Result 2: Finance professionals’ perception of the riskiness of the experimental asset drops markedly
during the COVID-19 stock market crash. In contrast, students do not exhibit changes in risk perception
across the waves.

Result 3: Finance professionals’ price and return forecasts and their satisfaction levels with the
asset do not differ between the two experimental waves. Again, students’ behavior does not differ
across waves.

Result 4a: Finance professionals’ investment levels are negatively associated with the direction of
the experimental shock. Students, in comparison, show lower investment levels in general, and
change their investment behavior following the experimental shocks to a lower degree.

Result 4b: Finance professionals perceive all volatility shocks in the experiment (i.e., DOWN,
STRAIGHT, or UP) to increase risk similarly, independent of the presentation format. Students
show partly similar patterns, but they do not perceive an upward price or return shock to increase
the riskiness of the stock.

Result 4c: Finance professionals’ price forecasts are in the direction of the experimental shock and
do not systematically differ between the presentation formats. Students exhibit similar patterns,
but show more extreme predictions when returns are presented.

Result 4d: Finance professionals’ investment satisfaction is positively correlated with the direction
of the experimental shock, but drops to pre-shock levels in the final period. Students show
qualitatively similar behavior.
