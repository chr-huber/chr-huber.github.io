# Introduction

<footer></footer>

# Motivation

- Financial markets:

  Dividend processes, returns, fundamental values are _imprecise_ / _vague_:

  - __probabilities__ over realizations are uncertain (ambiguity)
  
  - actual __amounts__ of realizations are uncertain

--

- __Aim of this study__:

  - Disentangle the effect of __uncertain probilities__ and __uncertain outcomes__
  
  - Relate investors _individual_ attitudes towards imprecision to _market outcomes_

# Related Literature

- Early incorporation of ambiguity in economic theory (Knight, 1921; Savage, 1954; Ellsberg, 1961)

  $\rightarrow$ challenged due to its incoherence with experimental observations
 
--

- Following work:

  - Camerer and Weber (1992): comprehensive framework
  
  - Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989): formalized the 'malevolent' decision rule

# Related Literature

Mixed experimental evidence for _ambiguity_ (imprecision in probabilities) aversion in __markets__:

--

  - Camerer and Kunreuther (1989): experimental markets for insurance against potential losses
    $\rightarrow$ mixed, minor effects
    
  - Weber (1989), Sarin and Weber (1993): multitude of experimental asset market designs
    $\rightarrow$ robust 'ambiguity premium'
    
  - Bossaerts et al. (2010): $\rightarrow$ ambiguity aversion under certain criteria
  
  - Kocher et al. (2013): self-selection into risky or ambiguous markets
    $\rightarrow$ no 'ambiguity premium'
    
  - F&uuml;llbrunn et al. (2014): $\rightarrow$ mixed effects

# Related Literature:

What about imprecision in _outcomes_?

--

- Du and Budescu (2005):

  - compare preferences for precise and imprecise probabilities and outcomes in individual choice tasks

  - $\rightarrow$ no 'ambiguity premium', but imprecision-_seeking_ for imprecise outcomes

--

Our contribution:

1. analyze the impact of imprecise probabilities _and_ imprecise outcomes in an _asset market environment_
2. relate individual attitudes/preferences to market outcomes

# Experimental Design

- 320 participants (80 in each treatment; 47% male, mean age 23 years)

- Between-subjects design with 4 treatments:

--

Treatment | Outcome Realizations  | Probabilities|
:---:     | :---:                 | :---:
RISK      | 58                    | 50%
          | 158                   | otherwise
--
IO        | [8, 108]              | 50%
          | [108, 208]            | otherwise
--
IP        | 58                    | [0%, 100%]
          | 158                   | otherwise
--
IOP       | [8, 108]              | [0%, 100%]
          | [108, 208]            | otherwise

# Experimental Design: Lottery draws

_Before_ each experimental session, we...

--

- sample distributions over probabilities (IP and IOP: [0%, 100%])
--

- sample distributions over realizations (IO and IOP: [8, 108] and [108, 208])

--

... using the random number generator on `random.org`

--

$\rightarrow$ sample distribution is uncertain

--

_At the end_ of each experimental session, we...

- randomly draw from this uncertain sample distribution

# Experimental Design

Two tasks:

1. __Individual decision-task__: elicit each subject's certainty equivalent (CE) for each treatment

2. __Continuous double-auction market__: observe market prices

# Individual decision-task

# Continuous double-auction market

- 8 traders per market, endowed w/ 800 Taler, 5 assets

- 3 minutes of single-unit trading

- same four treatments as for individual task: RISK, IO, IP, IOP

- treatments determine __buyback price__ of an asset at the end of trading
